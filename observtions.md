A very common phenomenon that I see taking place all the time IS:

(set on longs)
- long short ratio üîº in a downtends, the count of longs is increasing, the count of shorts is decreasing
- long short ratio ‚¨áÔ∏è in a uptrend, the count of longs is decreasing, the count of shorts is increasing

an Interesting fact is that l/s ratio is very correlated to CVD - volume aggregation delta
(it is aprox. 80% opposite correlation with l/s set on longs and 80% correlation with l/s set on shorts)

IN A UPTREND:

In a uptrend this is telling us the following things:

the count of ASKS which are: exiting longs + entering shorts (l/s down) is larger,
than the count of buying takers which are: entering longs + exiting shorts (l/s increase)

which means, the larger and quicker the price movement, the more diversified the ask side is going to be, 
in compariosn to the taker buying side

- in a uptrend more limit orders (makers) are going to open a position than market orders (takers)

- in a downtrend more limit orders are going to open a position than market orders

An interesting conclusion is that there are more limit orders than market orders, executing at pretty much all times. Market participans enter through limit more often than through taker.

And thanks to that: long short ratio is going to change with volume, if there are more market (taker) orders taking place
than a divergence between l/s ratio and CVD can take place, indicating taker fomo or poorly structured order book, which could be a sign of a potential reversal
