# Markert simulation software

prototype of a market simulation with transparent data

# Important note

- X => NEW LONG
- Y => NEW SHORT
- F => CLOSING LONG
- Z => CLOSING SHORT

needs to get final polish, in terms of:

- more dynamic spread options
- better psychology
- combine automated voume with orderbook insertions
- optimize performance (now there is too much unnecessary overwriting)
