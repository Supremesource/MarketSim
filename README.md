# Markert simulation software

prototype of a market simulation with transparent data

# Important note

- X => NEW LONG
- Y => NEW SHORT
- F => CLOSING LONG
- Z => CLOSING SHORT

needs to get final polish, in terms of:

- more dynamic spread options
- better psychology ** optional **
- make code more readable
- add liquidity factors
-- such as liquidations, leverage etc.


- generaly optimize
- optimize performance (now there is too much unnecessary overwriting)

# User manual

have fun!
