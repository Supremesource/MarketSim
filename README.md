# Markert simulation software

prototype of a market simulation with transparent data

# Important note

- X => NEW LONG
- Y => NEW SHORT
- F => CLOSING LONG
- Z => CLOSING SHORT

needs to get final polish, in terms of:

- more dynamic spread options
- better psychology
- add run tempeates/ 
,random run(dynamic)
,downtrend
,uptrend 
- fix the counterparty,- maker to interact with Order book
‹- will need to add triples instead of normal tuples and different evaluation, processing in the code.

- optimize performance (now there is too much unnecessary overwriting)

# User manual
! Do not forget to specify runSettings in /Settings !
