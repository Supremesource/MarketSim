# HOW DOES THE POSITION MANAGEMENT WORK ?
  /function is called recursively until the list of orders is empty

  1. First we take a list of volumes generated from other module
  2. With this list we change the orderbook -> Price change happens
  3. The list is passed into a `spitter`Â that spilts the list into `transactions`

  Now the fun begins
  we check if there are alredy any positions generated, if not we will have to
  generate them in the initGenerator (i should put this into the same generator
  , cause it does not really matter where i generate it)
  then we put these new positions (X, Y where x  = long, y = short)
  into a `basket` that represent the positons that can be closed.

  Now this basket is managed in terms of statistically asigning leverage
 as well as liquidation price.
 Now we have a list of positions that can be closed, with their liquidation price
 We can move onto the second runProgram through our recrusive function.

 / runProgram 2.
 Now we know which positions can be closed as well as some liquidation prices
 so same as in runProgram 1 we send our volume list into the orderbook -> change the price
 after we change the price we check if some position in that liquidation list
 should have been liquidated, if so we take it out of our basked of positions
 that can close and send the volume as Z or F (depends if it was a long or short
 ,who got liquidated). Now this `liquidation duty` transaction has to be pared
 with a counterparty of where we generate a opposite site that can consist of
 more than one position so we split the counterside volume and assign either
 new positions as a counterparty or exiting ones from our basket.

 Now we know there is no liquidation in our basked and we will make sense
 of the volume list that came to our funciton in the first place.
 This is done by taking the volume list splitting it (same as the initial runProgram)
 but the difference here is that we assign z and f for all of the transaction
 participains. Now we know how many exiting positions we had. So we take them
 out of our basked. We pass the new positioning as well as the new `Position future`
 which is the basket of potenitaly exiting positions. And we repeat the process
 until we reach our base case which is `[]` -> meaning we have no more volume.

 This is the time when we take out the accumulators:
 1. Orderbook
 2. Positioning
 3. Position Future

 And we write from the computer memory into external jsons. Then we
 can move onto the frontend/ do another simulation runProgram with different settings.

                                                                              -}

  PROCESS:

  1. generate new positioning from the volume list
  , this is being done by NormalGenerator
  , note that this takes the old future accumulators as well
  , hence if there are no pre\vious positions that should close
  , we generate them, and if there are, we take them into an account.

  2. generate new future:
  , the future stands for positions with closing mandate
  , (z -> close short ,  f -> close long)
  , this is being done by positionFuture, where we pass the current price
  , as well as the transaction from the step 1.

  3. filter out the old future
  , then we split the future into:
  , closing long & closing short
  , we split the transaction into
  , closing long & closing short
  , we take out the closing long from the old long future
  , and the closing short from the old short future

  4. return the new future and positioning
  , finally a transaction is returned
  , the new future coming out of the transaction is returned
  , updated old future is returned
